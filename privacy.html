    <h1>Privacy Policy for FUNTIMECHAT</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how FUNTIMECHAT ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application and website (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as your name, email address (if you sign up with email), and profile picture. We also collect content you create, such as messages and chat data, which are stored on Firebase servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide you with the features and functionality of the Service, including facilitating chat and video/audio calls.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share your data with Firebase (Google) for backend services (database, authentication) and with third-party providers for necessary functions (like sending notifications).</p>

    <h2>4. WebRTC (Real-Time Communication)</h2>
    <p>Our call features use WebRTC technology. Video and audio streams are transmitted **directly peer-to-peer** whenever possible and are **not** stored on our servers. Call signaling (setting up the connection) is handled via Firebase database.</p>
